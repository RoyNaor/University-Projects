# Ex1 – Graph Algorithms in C++

A C++ project that implements fundamental graph algorithms from scratch,
including BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Prim, and Kruskal, along with data structures like a queue and union-find.

---

## 📚 Features

- ✅ Custom `Graph` and `NeighborList` classes
- ✅ BFS & DFS traversal trees
- ✅ Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
- ✅ Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms for Minimum Spanning Trees
- ✅ Fixed-size queue (for BFS)
- ✅ Union-Find with path compression and union by rank (for Kruskal)
- ✅ Doctest unit tests with edge cases
- ✅ Clean and modular design

## 👷️ Building the Project

### Compile & Run the Main Program

```bash
make
./Ex1
```
---

## 🔪 Running Unit Tests

The project uses [doctest](https://github.com/doctest/doctest) for lightweight unit testing.

### Run all tests:

```bash
make test
```
---

## 🔍 Memory Leak Checking (Valgrind)

```bash
make valgrind
```

> Make sure Valgrind and doctest is installed:  
> `sudo apt install valgrind`
> `sudo apt install doctest`
